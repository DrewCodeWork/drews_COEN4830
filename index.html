<h3>My cat upon discovering I had mint gum in my backpack (2020)</h3>

<p>Context: Mint for cats is similar to catnip as they are from the same plant family (apparently), likely being why my cat wanted my mint gum.<br>
NOTE: As a general health standard, mint itself (at least the plant) is not safe for cat consumption.<br>
And gum, probably. Not like I'm gonna test that.</p>
